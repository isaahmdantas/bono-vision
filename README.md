# Data Analysis: Osteoporosis Risk Prediction

## Description
This repository contains dashboards and reports with data related to osteoporosis risk prediction. Osteoporosis is a health condition that weakens bones, making them brittle and more likely to break. The objective of this project is to use data analysis techniques to predict the risk of osteoporosis in patients based on different variables, such as age, bone mineral density, medical history, among others.
