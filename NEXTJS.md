### Node.js

This project requires Node.js to be installed on your system. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download and install it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

To verify if Node.js is installed, open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and type:

```bash
node --version
```

If Node.js is installed, it should print out the version number. If not, follow the instructions on the Node.js website to install it.

npm (Node Package Manager)
npm comes bundled with Node.js. To verify if npm is installed, you can run:

```bash
npm --version
```
